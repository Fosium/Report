In high school, my friend and I investigated and documented serious issues in the IT systems of our district. We used the exploits to 'Rickroll' around 35,000 staff and students, alerting the public to problems that had been neglected.

The IT department was unhappy, but with the support of the public and IT experts, our report was key in closing the security gaps the district had.

This version of the report is redacted, the full version was sent directly to the IT department for the problems to be addressed.
